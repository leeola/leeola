Dear Fictional Reader,

Welcome to what i am considering "fun". Wtf am i talking about you ask?
Well fictional reader, fun is something that doesn't have deadlines, doesn't
have quality requirements, and is totally as much or as little as i want. It's
something i control, something i entirely decide, and something i don't
have to ensure i am proud of. It's a stupid side project.

<span class="more"></span>

Any developer with any amount of passion has more ideas than time. If paired
with enough skill and knowledge to implement those ideas, it can be an
infuriating test of will. Worse yet, throw in some deadlines for those
ideas, with knowledge that people depend on your ideas being as good as *you*
expect them to be, and all of a sudden all of the fun is taken out of your
code.

I know i know, this is nothing new. But it's a often something i forget.
After two weeks of stressing about deadlines and projects, i sat down and
looked at the clock as it rolled to 9pm. I needed a break, i needed a stress
reliever.. but what to do? I want to code, to tinker, to toy.. it is my passion,
my hobby, but dammit i wanted fun, not work. Then it hit me.. i needed
something stupid.. which i think this blog qualifies as.

Why stupid though? What does this get me? Well, i'm not a writer *(I'm sure
that you're shocked)*.. but i wanted a project that *wasn't* one of my ideas.
Sure, i could have wrote some little web server that implemented some little
idea i've been toying with or wanting to do.. but that all seems so useful.
Useful things have requirements.. have needs. This blog does not. It's stupid,
wasteful, and very likely ugly.

So here it is. My fun, my art. I'm not proud of it, i'm not excited about it,
i'm sure as hell not passionate about it.. but hey, it actually has been a bit
of fun.

Down a couple beers, tinker with some silly code, and lose some stress. I'd
call this a win :)
